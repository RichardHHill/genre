# Genre

This app is all about studying the *genre* of words in the French language. All data comes from the Lexique database:
http://www.lexique.org/

There are two parts to this tool. The first is a study mode: the user can practice the 1200 most common nouns in the
French language in 20-word quizzes. The second is a collection of tools to explore the data behind French *genre*.
